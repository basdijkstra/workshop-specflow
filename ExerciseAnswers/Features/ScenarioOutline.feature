Feature: ScenarioOutline
	In order to avoid duplicate scenario and unreadable features
	As a SpecFlow student
	I want to learn how to refactor common scenarios into a scenario outline

Background: Create a Calculator and its initial state
	Given I have a calculator
	And the calculator shows 5 in its display

Scenario Outline: Addition
	When I add <ValueToAdd>
	Then the calculator shows <NewTotal> in its display
	Examples: 
		| ValueToAdd | NewTotal |
		| 5          | 10       |
		| 1          | 6        |
		| 14         | 19       |
		| 12340      | 12345    |
